# Stacks and Queues: Fundamental Data Structures

Welcome to the guide on stacks and queues, two fundamental data structures in computer science. This document aims to provide an overview of LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) concepts, explain stacks and queues, and cover their common implementations and use cases.

## 1. LIFO and FIFO
LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) are ordering principles used to manage data. LIFO implies that the last item added is the first one removed, while FIFO indicates that the first item added is the first one removed.

## 2. Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle. It's ideal for managing function calls, tracking program execution, and solving problems like parentheses matching.

## 3. Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. It's useful for tasks such as managing print jobs, task scheduling, and breadth-first search algorithms.

## 4. Common Implementations
Stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Arrays offer efficient random access, while linked lists are more flexible for dynamic allocation.

## 5. Use Cases
- **Stacks**: Function call management, expression evaluation, undo functionality in applications.
- **Queues**: Task scheduling, print spooling, breadth-first search in graph algorithms.

## 6. Using Global Variables
Global variables are accessible from any part of a program. While they offer convenience, their excessive use can lead to code complexity and unintended side effects. It's recommended to minimize the use of global variables and opt for modular, organized code.

Feel free to explore each section to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and how they can be applied in various programming scenarios.
